# Consul Agent in Docker

This project is a Docker container for [Consul](http://www.consul.io/). It's a slightly opinionated, pre-configured Consul Agent made specifically to work in the Docker ecosystem.

## Getting the container

The container is very small (50MB virtual, based on [Busybox](https://github.com/akolosov/docker-busybox)) and available on the Docker Index:

	$ docker pull akolosov/consul-agent
